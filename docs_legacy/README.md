# Legacy Documentation (DEPRECATED)

⚠️ **This directory is deprecated and maintained for historical reference only.**

## Current Documentation

Please visit the **current documentation** at:
- **Live Site**: https://fabriziosalmi.github.io/trinity/
- **Source**: `docs/` directory

## Why This Was Deprecated

1. **Modern Stack**: VitePress provides better search, navigation, and UX
2. **Duplicate Maintenance**: Maintaining two doc versions was inefficient
3. **Better Developer Experience**: docs/ has sidebar, search, and dark mode
4. **Already Deployed**: GitHub Pages workflow serves docs/

## Migration Status

All valuable content has been migrated to `docs/`. This directory contains:
- Historical refactoring guides
- Old release notes (now in CHANGELOG.md)
- Legacy architecture docs (updated in docs/)

## Removal Timeline

This directory will be **removed in v0.8.0** (next major release).

If you need any content from here:
1. Check `docs/` first (it's probably there)
2. Check `CHANGELOG.md` for release notes
3. Open an issue if something is missing
